## About CodeTime

- CodeTime is a plugin for Sublime Text editor which will help developers to track the amount of time spent on multiple files, programming languages and projects. The user will be able to perform the analysis of the time spent to improve the productivity by analysing the most frequently used programming language, most productive time of the day, files in project which took maximum time for development and projects which took maximum time for completion.

- The online dashboard can be used to track the developers' productivity and view charts displaying how much time the user spent on each kind of file they worked on.
